	- Shipping methods
		- Have a setting where they select which countries they will ship to, and also the "global default shipping rate"
		- Then have regional shipping rates
	- No account option for non-subscriptions (just create an empty account, no password, just an email and then a first name/last name from the billing address?)
	- Content/Form/Product Privileges
	- Add in Hooks everywhere
	- MailChimp integration
		- Keep a list of users updated
		- Send email when article is published

- Order Form:
	- settings: require_user_account
	- When a user makes an order, their customer record is forever tied to their user account
		- It's updated with each purchase (stores their billing address, etc.)
		
- When copying code from OpenGateway:
	- Copy database
	- Replace all calls to client_model
	- Delete all references to client_id
	- Make all "in-model" model loads call billing/model (not just model).
		- Find in /modules/billing/models "load->model('" and replace with "load->model('billing"
	- Add "validate" class to forms
	- Get rid of lang calls
	
- Orders
	- "customer_id" may lead to a member, if the user had an account
	- Link to members
	- Link to a customer record for shipping data (return shipping as $order['shipping']['first_name'] etc. - $order['shipping'] = FALSE if no shipping)
	- Link to a charge
- Subscriptions
	- Link to a subscription_plan
		- Link to plan (extends plan)
	- Links to members via customer_id
- Templates
	- Have ".thtml" extension
	
- Requires: PHP5, mod_rewrite, cURL, fopen_allow_url = On, GD2 for thumbnails (or ImageMagick if you update the image_manipulation library)
