- Roadmap:
	- Add image manager (AJAX manager/library)
	- Product custom fields
	- Product options (more custom fields)
	- Make store accessible only to certain usergroup(s) (Store Configuration)
	- Tax rules (options: Applies to subscriptions)
	- Add setting: require_account for orders
	- Limit user_fields to subscription_plans and products via serialized arrays in `user_fields`
	- Write documentation for model's Get function requirements for Datasets (filters, etc.)
	- Update Dataset to have sorting
	- Minify ".js" files automatic with Electric Packager
	
- Order Form:
	- settings: require_user_account
	- When a user makes an order, their customer record is forever tied to their user account
		- It's updated with each purchase (stores their billing address, etc.)
		
- When copying code from OpenGateway:
	- Copy database
	- Delete all references to client_id
	- Make all "in-model" model loads call billing/model (not just model).
		- Find in /modules/billing/models "load->model('" and replace with "load->model('billing"
	- Add "validate" class to forms
	- Get rid of lang calls
	
	
- Orders
	- "customer_id" may lead to a member, if the user had an account
	- Link to members
	- Link to a customer record for shipping data (return shipping as $order['shipping']['first_name'] etc. - $order['shipping'] = FALSE if no shipping)
	- Link to a charge
- Subscriptions
	- Link to a subscription_plan
		- Link to plan (extends plan)
	- Links to members via customer_id
