- Roadmap:	
	- Add delayed publishing for all content
	- Add Content template plugin
	
	- Comments moderator (modeled after WordPress) and comments model/library
	- Create Search Manager (which content types are available, how often to rebuild index, etc.)
	- Apply time_since/formatting to each Admin panel date
	- Make store accessible only to certain usergroup(s) (Store Configuration)
	- Add setting: require_account for orders
	- Update Dataset to have sorting
	- Allow multi-page articles with "Insert PageBreak"
	- When previewing/arranging fields, make sure that we don't have any "full" fields, as they create two draggable items (one for each LI)
	- Add Affiliates Module (affiliate code already exists in subscriptions table)
	- Video module: Add a video and give embed code for the video
	- Template File Browser/Editor
	
- Order Form:
	- settings: require_user_account
	- When a user makes an order, their customer record is forever tied to their user account
		- It's updated with each purchase (stores their billing address, etc.)
		
- When copying code from OpenGateway:
	- Copy database
	- Delete all references to client_id
	- Make all "in-model" model loads call billing/model (not just model).
		- Find in /modules/billing/models "load->model('" and replace with "load->model('billing"
	- Add "validate" class to forms
	- Get rid of lang calls
	
- Orders
	- "customer_id" may lead to a member, if the user had an account
	- Link to members
	- Link to a customer record for shipping data (return shipping as $order['shipping']['first_name'] etc. - $order['shipping'] = FALSE if no shipping)
	- Link to a charge
- Subscriptions
	- Link to a subscription_plan
		- Link to plan (extends plan)
	- Links to members via customer_id
- Templates
	- Have ".thtml" extension
- Modules
	- Defined in /modules/modname/modname.php
	- Mandatory Methods:
		- __construct();
	- Optional Methods:
		- admin_preload();
			- Build admin navigation
		- front_preload();
			- Add template plugin directories with $this->CI->smarty->addPluginsDir();
		- update($db_version);
			- Create settings, writeable folders, and update the database
	
- Requires: PHP5, mod_rewrite, cURL, fopen_allow_url = On, GD2 for thumbnails (or ImageMagick if you update the image_manipulation library)
