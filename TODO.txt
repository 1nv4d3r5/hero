- Roadmap:
	- Comment Admin_form library
	- Comment Custom_fields module
	- Comment User_model
	- Investigate why unique_username and unique_email do not get triggered
	- Ordering of custom fields
	- Create "subscription_plans" model/table, extending "plans" (they'll share ID\'s)
	- Update TriggerTrips to pull member information, if available, as well as the billing address (not called "customer" anymore)
	- Allow TriggerTrips to take additional parameters (e.g., "[PASSWORD]" when registering users).
	- Create a customer record when a user is created in NewUser
		- When creating user custom fields, they can specify if the field should be used as the "Address",
		"City", etc. of the user, to auto-populate this billing address!
		- First name, last name, and email are auto-populated
	- Limit user_fields to subscription_plans and products via serialized arrays in `user_fields`
	- Create admin panel authentication system
	- Move "Initialize" arguments to their own methods (e.g., $this->dataset->DataSource('order_model','GetCharges'));
	- Update Dataset to "Export" with CSV ($this->dataset->ExportMethod())
	- Write documentation for model's Get function requirements (filters, etc.)
	- Update Dataset to have sorting
	
- Order Form:
	- settings: require_user_account
	- When a user makes an order, their customer record is forever tied to their user account
		- It's updated with each purchase (stores their billing address, etc.)
		
- When copying code from OpenGateway:
	- Copy database
	- Delete all references to client_id
	- Make all "in-model" model loads call billing/model (not just model).
		- Find in /modules/billing/models "load->model('" and replace with "load->model('billing"
	- Add "validate" class to forms
	- Get rid of lang calls
