- Roadmap:
	- Create Menu Manager
	- Comments moderator (modeled after WordPress) and comments model/library
	- Create Search Manager (which content types are available, how often to rebuild index, etc.)
	- Add Default View Template to each Content Type add/edit
	- Add Template to each blog/listings add/edit
	- Apply time_since/formatting to each Admin panel date
	- Make store accessible only to certain usergroup(s) (Store Configuration)
	- Add setting: require_account for orders
	- Update Dataset to have sorting
	- Allow multi-page articles with "Insert PageBreak"
	
- Order Form:
	- settings: require_user_account
	- When a user makes an order, their customer record is forever tied to their user account
		- It's updated with each purchase (stores their billing address, etc.)
		
- When copying code from OpenGateway:
	- Copy database
	- Delete all references to client_id
	- Make all "in-model" model loads call billing/model (not just model).
		- Find in /modules/billing/models "load->model('" and replace with "load->model('billing"
	- Add "validate" class to forms
	- Get rid of lang calls
	
- Orders
	- "customer_id" may lead to a member, if the user had an account
	- Link to members
	- Link to a customer record for shipping data (return shipping as $order['shipping']['first_name'] etc. - $order['shipping'] = FALSE if no shipping)
	- Link to a charge
- Subscriptions
	- Link to a subscription_plan
		- Link to plan (extends plan)
	- Links to members via customer_id
	
- Requires: PHP5, mod_rewrite, cURL, fopen_allow_url = On, GD2 for thumbnails (or ImageMagick if you update the image_manipulation library)
