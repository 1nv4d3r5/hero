- When copying code from OpenGateway:
	- Copy database
	- Replace all calls to client_model
	- Delete all references to client_id
	- Make all "in-model" model loads call billing/model (not just model).
		- Find in /modules/billing/models "load->model('" and replace with "load->model('billing"
	- Add "validate" class to forms
	- Get rid of lang calls
	
- Requires: PHP5, mod_rewrite, cURL, fopen_allow_url = On, GD2 for thumbnails (or ImageMagick if you update the image_manipulation library)
