[h1]Privileges Array[/h1]

All modules containing content such as the Publish module, Form module, and Blog module, return a [span_code]$privileges[/span_code] array
as part of their template files.  This array contains the member group ID numbers of each member group that can access the content.  It may also contain
the ID "0", or be empty, in which case the content is public.

This array is important because it can be used to manually restrict access to content, if not using the [paywall](Auto-Paywall).

The template plugin, [span_code]{restricted}[/span_code], is used to verify if the current logged in user has the permissions to view the content
based on the [span_code]$privileges[/span_code] array.  For example:

[code]
{restricted in_group=$privileges}
	You are in this group.  I'll show you the full article:
	
	{$title}
	Published on {$date}.
	
	{$body}
{/restricted}

{restricted not_in_group=$privileges}
	You are not in the group.  Sorry.
{/restricted}
[/code]

As you can see, we also the used [span_code]not_in_group[/span_code] parameter of this template plugin to see if the user was denied access to the content.  This is helpful
in showing an error message or login form.  It is highly recommended to show a login form and registration link when a user is denied access so that
they can remedy the situation.  The [paywall](Auto-Paywall) does this automatically, but it doesn't give you as much control as you may need.
