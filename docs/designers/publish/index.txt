[h2]Displaying Content[/h2]

Content, by default, is displayed through the [filename]content.thtml[/filename] template.  However, as you can define any type of content type with an unlimited number of custom fields, it is not likely that one template will suffice.  You can choose to display a specific content type through another template by specifying the "Output Template" when adding/editing a content type in the control panel in Publish > Content Types.

All content variables are available in this template as standard Smarty templates (and can be modified as such).  By default, all standard content includes the following variables:

* [span_code]{$title}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$date}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$modified_date}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$author_id}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$author_username}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$author_first_name}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$author_last_name}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$author_email}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$type_id}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$type_name}[/span_code]
* [span_code]{$url_path}[/span_code] (relative URL to the content)
* [span_code]{$url}[/span_code] (absolute URL to the content)
* [span_code]{$template}[/span_code] (template filename)
