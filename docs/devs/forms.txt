[h1]Forms[/h1]

A critical component of the control panel is *forms*.  Forms are built using an expandable library of fieldtypes (defined as PHP classes at [filename]/app/modules/custom_fields/libraries/fieldtypes/[/filename]).

In the control panel, forms are displayed with the Form_builder library ([filename]/app/modules/custom_fields/libraries/Œform_builder.php[/filename]).  In the frontend, forms are built by parsing each individual field with the [span_code]{custom_field}[/span_code] template plugin (documented below).
